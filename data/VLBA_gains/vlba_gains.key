!                VLBA GAINS FILE
!
!
!  This is a KEYIN format file that contains calibration and sensitivity
!  information for the VLBA as determined from single-dish pointing
!  observations.
!
!  The file contains one group of input records for each station/band.
!  There is a time range associated with each group that corresponds to a
!  period during which the calibration values should have been stable.  A
!  new group is begun whenever there is a receiver change or some antenna
!  change (such as subreflector changes) that might alter the gains.
!  The values for the gains and temperatures are averages of all data
!  taken during the timerange.  Typically one set of observations is made
!  each week as part of system verification.  Longer runs are made
!  occasionally.  The averages use a robust averaging technique that
!  severely downweights discrepant points, which are typically the result
!  of weather or system problems.
!
!  Individual "GAIN" lines can be extracted from this file and used
!  for data calibration with programs ANCAL (AIPS) or CAL (Caltech).
!  The file is used as-is by a number of programs related to the
!  derivation and display of VLBA performance parameters. (PTANAL,
!  GAINTABLE, PLOTTS, PLOTSUM, and NEWGAIN).  It is also used for
!  the calibration transfer by the VLBA correlator.
!
!  The parameters are:
!     BAND           Frequency band.  Needed to distinguish sx.
!     TIMERANG       Range of times for which the parameters apply.
!                      (yr1,month1,day1,hour1,yr2,month2,day2,hr2).
!     FREQ           Frequency in MHz.
!     COMMENT        May contain a reason for new timerange.
!     TS             Average RCP and LCP zenith system temperatures.
!     TR             Average RCP and LCP receiver temperatures.  This
!                      is TS minus atmosphere and the elevation
!                      dependent part of spillover.
!     TCAL           RCP and LCP cal value used to get Ts and gain.
!     FT             Scale factor for known poor Tcal.  The DPFU given
!                      has been determined assuming that this correction
!                      has been made.  Making the correction is
!                      especially important if the system temperatures
!                      are to be used to derive opacity corrections.
!                      Use this factor by including it on the "TSYS"
!                      card in ANCAL or CAL input.
!     Station Name   The two letter code for the station.
!     GAIN           A record type flag for ANCAL and CAL.
!     ALTAZ          Mount type for ANCAL and CAL.
!     DPFU           The RCP and LCP sensitivities (K/Jy).
!     POLY           Coefficients (up to 7) for a polynomial gain curve.
!                    These are relative to the zenith angle in degrees.
!     /              End of an input group.
!
!
!  NOTES    ---  If the TCAL and TSYS values are 0, there were no
!                data for this receiver/band/pol at the last update.
!                The DPFU will be whatever was in the old file which
!                is probably a reasonable default.
!
!                Where the 1 cm gain curves are not flat, they show
!                a linear decrease with zenith angle.  For 2cm, we used to
!                assume that the curves have the same form but that
!                the magnitude of the decrease is one half that seen
!                at 1 cm.  More recently, and certainly by mid 2002,
!                gain curves at 2cm, 1cm, and 7mm are the results of
!                fits to pointing data.
